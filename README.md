# odin-recipes
This is my first project with HTML, I put into practice all the knowledge that I have been acquiring with The Odin Project during a week.
I didn't have too much difficult with HTML, but using Git a had some trouble to commit. It took me a time to understand it, im going to put it more into practice.
